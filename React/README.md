# Fullstack Toy Project

## Objective
To create the REACT frontend for the Django toy project.

This project consists of the frontend portion for the DRF project. It uses React library for this purpose. We can perform CRUD operations on data from the database created for the project.

## Contents
The contents of this directory include:

- **public**: This folder contains files that have been automatically generated by React for this project.
- **src**: This folder contains the source files for this project.
- **README.md**: This is the file we are in. It contains details about this project, its files and specific instructions on how to run the code.
- **package-lock.json**: This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the ```node_modules``` tree, or ```package.json```.
- **package.json**: This file contains all dependencies for the React part of the project.

## Instructions to run the code

1. Create a separate directory for this project using ```mkdir```.
2. Clone the project using the submitted URL using ```git clone``` inside this directory.
3. Enter the project directory using ```cd```.
4. Ensure that all dependencies have been downloaded from ```package.json``` file using ```npm install```. 
5. After installing all dependencies, run the project using ```npm start```. This will automatically open up a new tab in the browser.
6. Visit ```http://localhost:3000/login``` to get to the login page. After this you can explore the application to perform CRUD operations.
7. After inspection, close the tab and return to the terminal.
8. Press ```Ctrl + C``` to stop the server.

## Notes

1. Dependencies that need to be installed have been included in the package.json file.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
